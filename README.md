# 🌦️ Weather Health Alert System  

This project is a **Node.js-based weather health alert system**.  
It fetches real-time weather data (temperature, humidity, wind, description, etc.) and provides **health risk alerts** along with **preventive measures** in JSON format.  

---

## 🚀 Features  

- Fetches weather data from a free weather API (Weatherbit, OpenWeather, etc.).  
- Maps weather conditions to possible **health risks**.  
- Suggests **preventive measures** based on risks.  
- JSON-based mapping for easy customization.  
- Simple Node.js server with API endpoints.

## 📦 Installation  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-health-alert.git
   cd weather-health-alert
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API key:

   ```env
   WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Node.js** – Backend
* **Express.js** – API handling
* **Axios / Fetch** – For weather API calls
* **dotenv** – Environment variables

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add database support (MongoDB / MariaDB) for storing weather history.
* Add user authentication.
* Push notifications for alerts.
* Dashboard UI (React/Angular).
